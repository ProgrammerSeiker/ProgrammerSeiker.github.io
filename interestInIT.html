            You should answer the questions below as best you can. Each answer should be one
            paragraph in length.
            What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular
            event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).
            Why did you choose to come to RMIT?
            What do you expect to learn during your studies?
          </h3>
          <p>
            My interest in IT is almost too much to summarise, I love coding, AI, security, hardware development and games.
            When I was smaller, I loved lego and drawing because it allowed me to have the freedom to create and forge.
            Eventually, I started becoming obsessed with technology and its relevence in the modern world.
            My love for coding started when I was coding command blocks in Minecraft, I use to make different maps for all my friends to play on.
            I use to work for my step dad in coding, I made web emails and helped to create emails for companies to distrubute.
          </br>
          </br>
            I have always wanted to go to RMIT since about year 9, however I changed my preference to Monash during my last weeks in year 12.
            I changed because I wanted to be with my friends since most of them were going to Monash, however I ended up changing once again during the last days of preferences.
            RMIT has a great reputation for IT subjects within the education community, so I wanted to attend RMIT to achieve the same heights others before me have.
          </br>
          </br>
            I hope to improve my team work mostly during my studies at RMIT as I have never been too good with communication.
            I would also like to improve my knowledge on AI, security and databases/cloud storages as they all have important functions in society.
            The lessons I expect to learn would all be based around team work and logical thinking as both are very important within IT.
